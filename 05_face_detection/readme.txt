TASK 5
FACE DETECTION AND RECOGNITION

📌 Project Description:
I'm excited to share my recent achievement in creating an AI face detection using pre-trained face detection model Haar cascades.

Key Highlights:
1. Face Detection from Live Camera Feed: The program captures video from your computer's camera, detects faces in real-time, and allows you to capture images of the detected faces.

2. Face Detection from Images: It provides the option to upload an image, and upon selection, the system detects faces in the image and outlines them. You can also capture and save the detected faces as separate image files.

3. Face Detection from Videos: You can upload a video file, and the program detects faces in each frame of the video. It not only displays the video with face outlines but also saves the frames containing detected faces as image files. Additionally, it generates an output video file with the faces outlined.

📈 Results: This system is designed for ease of use, and a user-friendly dashboard provides options to access each of the functionalities.

ðŸŽ® Task 2 Completed: Tic-Tac-Toe AI with GUI

I'm thrilled to share my latest project - a Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI opponent! In this project, I utilized Python's tkinter library to build a graphical user interface for the game. It features a 3x3 game board where you can play against an AI opponent that employs the minimax algorithm for decision making.

Here are some key features:
âœ… Player vs. AI Gameplay: Challenge yourself against a smart AI that makes strategic moves.
âœ… Scoring System: Keep track of your wins against the AI.
âœ… Interactive Interface: Click on the grid to make your moves, and the AI will respond accordingly.
    Note: Once the game is over you have to click on 'Reset' and then 'Start' to keep track of the progress.

ðŸš€ I'm excited to showcase my coding skills and the AI's gameplay in a demo video. Big thanks to CodSoft for the inspiration and support!
Watch the demo video and try out the game for yourself.
